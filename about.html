      Hey there! My name is Eugene Romero, I am a 30-something year old tech
      enthusiast, speaker, retro gamer, and general nerd. I work as a Senior
      Cloud and DevOps Engineer at
      <a href="https://www.capgemini.com/">Capgemini</a>.
    </p>
    <p class="about-p">
      This blog is mostly dedicated to discussing DevOps tools, Cloud, Linux,
      Automation, Infrastructure-As-Code, and whatever other subject catches my
      interest that week. From time to time you might also find different posts
      on other geek related subjects.
