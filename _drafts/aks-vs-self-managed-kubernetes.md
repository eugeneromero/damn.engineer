Kubernetes has become the de facto standard for container orchestration, allowing organizations to automate deployment, scaling, and management of applications. The rise of cloud computing has made it possible to run Kubernetes on various cloud platforms, including Microsoft Azure. Microsoft offers two ways to run Kubernetes on Azure: Azure Kubernetes Services (AKS) and self-managed Kubernetes. In this blog post, we will compare these two options and discuss the advantages of using AKS over self-managed Kubernetes.

First and foremost, AKS provides a managed Kubernetes service, meaning that Microsoft takes care of the management and maintenance of the control plane, the nodes, and their underlying infrastructure. With self-managed Kubernetes, the responsibility for the management and maintenance of the control plane and nodes lies with the organization. This can become a significant burden, especially for organizations that lack the expertise and resources to manage a Kubernetes cluster.

Another advantage of AKS is that it integrates seamlessly with other Azure services, such as Azure Active Directory, Azure Monitor, and Azure DevOps. This integration provides a streamlined and cohesive experience for organizations that use multiple Azure services. Self-managed Kubernetes, on the other hand, requires manual integration with other services and can become complex and time-consuming.

AKS also offers automatic upgrades, which ensures that the cluster is always running the latest version of Kubernetes. Self-managed Kubernetes requires manual upgrades, which can be a time-consuming and error-prone process. In addition, AKS provides a simple and convenient upgrade process, reducing the risk of downtime or disruption to the applications running on the cluster.

Another key advantage of AKS is its scalability. AKS can easily scale up or down based on the needs of the applications running on the cluster. With self-managed Kubernetes, organizations must manually add or remove nodes, which can be a time-consuming process.

AKS also provides built-in security features, such as Azure Active Directory integration and network segmentation. These features help organizations secure their Kubernetes cluster and applications running on the cluster. Self-managed Kubernetes requires manual configuration and maintenance of security features, which can be a complex and time-consuming process.

Finally, AKS offers a more cost-effective solution compared to self-managed Kubernetes. Organizations only pay for the resources they consume, such as the number of nodes and their respective sizes, and do not need to invest in additional infrastructure or personnel to manage the Kubernetes cluster. Self-managed Kubernetes, on the other hand, requires organizations to invest in additional infrastructure, personnel, and maintenance costs, which can quickly add up.

In conclusion, Azure Kubernetes Services offers numerous advantages over self-managed Kubernetes. AKS provides a managed Kubernetes service, integrates seamlessly with other Azure services, offers automatic upgrades, provides scalable resources, offers built-in security features, and is more cost-effective. These advantages make AKS a compelling solution for organizations looking to run Kubernetes on Azure.
