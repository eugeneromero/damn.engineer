NDC Oslo 2023 took place in May 2023 in Oslo (Norway). At that event, I presented the talk **"Securing your app's communications with Kubernetes, Azure Key Vault, and TLS certificates"**, in which I discussed how to use the Kubernetes [Secrets Store CSI Driver](https://secrets-store-csi-driver.sigs.k8s.io) to automatically inject TLS certificates from an Azure Key Vault into Kubernetes pods.

This talk presents the information I wrote about in an [earlier post]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/2022/02/07/tls-cert-azure-keyvault-kubernetes) on this blog.

This talk is about 15 minutes long. The slides for the talk can be found [here]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/talk-slides/ndc-kubernetes-secrets-store-csi-driver/).
