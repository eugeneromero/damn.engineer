DevOpsDays Amsterdam is one of the several DevOpsDays conferences that take place every year around the world. Their aim is to connect professionals working with DevOps technologies, and present the latest advancements in DevOps technologies and methods. This time, I was invited to present the talk **"Daily stand ups will make us a DevOps team, and other fun things management says"**, a light-hearted lightning talk in which I discuss the prevalence of buzzwords and inflated speak in the corporate IT world.

The talk is short (5 minutes). The slides for the talk can be found [here]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/talk-slides/management-speek-translator/).
