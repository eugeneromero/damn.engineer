Hashiconf Europe took place in June of 2022 in Amsterdam (The Netherlands). At that conference, I presented the hallway track **"Real Life End-to-End Building, Testing, and Deploying of a Buzzword-Heavy Application"**, in which I showcased a real life application built around all the buzzwords: cloud-native, Kubernetes, microservices, Docker, and many more. I discussed how we automated the building, testing, and deploying of the app with Terraform, what some of the challenges were, and what wins we have experienced.

The talk is about 15 minutes long. The slides for the talk can be found [here]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/talk-slides/terraform-end-to-end/).

Hope you enjoy it!
