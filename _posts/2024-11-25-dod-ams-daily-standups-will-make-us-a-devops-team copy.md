NDC Oslo is the premier developer conference in Norway. At this year's conference I had the chance to present the talk "An unpopular opinion: Get rid of Pull Requests!", a 15 minute lightning talk where I discuss some of the issues with pull requests and how to possibly alleviate them. The theme of the talk is lighthearted, and the main objective is to remind developers to periodically spend some time reviewing the reasons for performing certain rituals or activities in their projects.

The slides for the talk can be found [here]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/talk-slides/an-unpopular-opinion-get-rid-of-pull-requests/).
