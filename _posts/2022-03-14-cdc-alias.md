## Creating a Bash function for navigating and autocompleting any filesystem directory

If you are like me, and spend all day typing on a keyboard, you start looking for ways to save yourself a keystroke here and there. This quest for ultimate performance led me to try and find a way to speed up navigating into a directory in my Bash terminal.

### Why?

There are many reasons why a method for quickly navigating into a directory might make sense. For example, long (or capitalized) directory names. Say that you find yourself having to navigate to `/media/external/Code` on a regular basis, because that is where your keep your repositories. Wouldn't it be nice to have a quick alias to get yourself there instead of having to type out the path every time?

_"But Damn Dot Engineer"_ I hear you say, _"wouldn't it be enough to create an `alias` for that specific `cd` command? Why write an article about this?"_

Because I have a self-imposed article quota to fill. Also, because **autocomplete**. If I create an alias such as

```bash
alias cdc="cd /media/external/Code"
```

this _will_ work for navigating to that specific directory. However, what if I want to continue navigating _inside_ of that directory? Say for example my desired destination is `/media/external/Code/www/site`. To reach that directory with the above alias, I would have to do it in two commands:

```bash
cdc
cd www/site
```

That is hardly useful, is it? Instead, I wanted to have a command that would work the same way as the normal `cd` command does, allowing me to use [tab] for autocompleting paths, and for showing what is inside of a directory with a double [tab] press.

### The Solution

Lets build a simple solution, using nothing else than a couple of Bash functions.

#### Prerequisite

This little helper uses the `_cd` built-in function. Most "regular" Linux distributions I have tried (such as my daily driver Ubuntu) already have this function included. However, I noticed that the official Ubuntu Docker image did not have it. You can check if your Bash has it by running these two commands:

```bash
bash --debugger
declare -F _cd
# _cd 1726 /usr/share/bash-completion/bash_completion
```

You should get output telling you where the function is declared (in my case above, it's declared in `/usr/share/bash-completion/bash_completion`). If the output is empty, your Bash does not have the `_cd` function yet. To add it, install the [bash-completion](https://repology.org/project/bash-completion/versions) package, and then make sure these lines appear in your `.bashrc`:

```bash
if [ -f /etc/bash_completion ] && ! shopt -oq posix; then
    . /etc/bash_completion
fi
```

#### The Bash function

Add the following block at the end of your `.bashrc`, adjusting the `cdc_path` variable to the base path you want to navigate to:

```bash
### cdc command
cdc_path='/media/external/Code'

_cdc () {
  declare CDPATH=
  cd "$cdc_path"
  _cd "$@"
}

complete -F _cdc cdc

cdc () {
  if [ -z "$@" ]; then
    cd "$cdc_path";
  else
    cd "$cdc_path"/"$@";
  fi
}
###
```

What does this do?

First off, the `_cdc` function uses the `_cd` function to search for directories inside of `cdc_path`. The functionality is the same as that of the regular `cd` autocomplete. Any results are added to the arguments of the `cdc` command so that, upon pressing [enter], Bash navigates to that directory.

#### Limitations

The `_cdc` function needs to navigate to `cdc_path` to be able to correctly autocomplete folders. If the operation is cancelled (for example, by pressing [ctrl]+[C] _after_ using [tab] to see results), the terminal still ends up navigating to `cdc_path`. I have not found a simple way to avoid navigating away without breaking the autocomplete functionality. This is a minor bug for me, since it does not happen too often and a `cd -` gets me back to wherever I was originally.
