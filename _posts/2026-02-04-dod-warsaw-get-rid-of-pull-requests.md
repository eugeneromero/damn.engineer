This is an extended version of the talk I have presented at other conferences in the past. In it, I discuss some of the issues with pull requests and how to possibly alleviate them.

The slides for the talk can be found [here]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/talk-slides/an-unpopular-opinion-get-rid-of-pull-requests-long/).
