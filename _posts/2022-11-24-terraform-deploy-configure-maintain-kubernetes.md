Kubernetes Community Days took place in June of 2022 in Berlin (Germany). At that conference, I presented the talk **"Automate Every Layer: Using Terraform to Deploy, Configure and Maintain Azure Kubernetes Clusters"**, in which I discussed how we use Terraform to control the entire lifecycle of Azure Kubernetes clusters.

This talk is about 35 minutes long. The slides for the talk can be found [here]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/talk-slides/terraform-managed-clusters/).
