Azure Container Apps are a new, flexible alternative to full-fledged Kubernetes clusters. As with other application platforms, the question of how to securely work with secrets is quickly raised.

In this talk, I discuss how secrets stored in Key Vaults can be safely and securely consumed by applications running in Azure Container Apps. The presentation includes a demonstration where I show the setup in action.

The slides for the talk can be found [here]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/talk-slides/securely-consuming-secrets-in-azure-container-apps/), and the files for the demo are [here](https://github.com/eugeneromero/container-app-secrets).
